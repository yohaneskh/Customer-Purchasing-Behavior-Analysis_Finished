# Customer-Purchasing-Behavior-Analysis_Finished

This repository contains an end-to-end unsupervised machine learning project to analyze and segment customers based on their demographics and purchasing behavior. 
By leveraging clustering techniques, we aim to uncover hidden patterns and customer groups that can inform targeted marketing strategies.

### A. Objective
The objective is to segment customers using **KMeans Clustering**, based on features such as age group, income level, spending habits, and product engagement. The resulting clusters help identify distinct customer personas for data-driven marketing decisions, retention strategies, and personalization.

### C. Workflow Overview
1. Importing Libraries
- Essential Python packages were imported for analysis, visualization, and modeling.

2. Loading and Inspecting the Dataset
