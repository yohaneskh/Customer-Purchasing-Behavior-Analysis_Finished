# Customer-Purchasing-Behavior-Analysis_Finished

This repository contains an end-to-end unsupervised machine learning project to analyze and segment customers based on their demographics and purchasing behavior. 
By leveraging clustering techniques, we aim to uncover hidden patterns and customer groups that can inform targeted marketing strategies.

## A. Objective

The resulting clusters help identify distinct customer personas for data-driven marketing decisions, retention strategies, and personalization.
